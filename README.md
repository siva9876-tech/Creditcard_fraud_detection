# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection System




## 📌 Overview
Credit card fraud is a major challenge for banks and financial institutions as fraudulent transactions are rare and often hidden among millions of legitimate activities.
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using a Random Forest Classifier, handling highly imbalanced data and identifying suspicious patterns based on spending behavior, transaction frequency, amount, location, and time.
## 🧠 Key Features
✅ Random Forest-based classification  
✅ Imbalanced data handling (Oversampling/Underweighting)  
✅ Fraud probability scoring  
✅ Performance metrics evaluation  
✅ Interactive Streamlit web app  
✅ Visual insights on fraudulent patterns
## 🌴Why Random Forest?
➡️Random Forest works extremely well for fraud detection because:
➡️Handles nonlinear relationships  
➡️Robust to noisy data  
➡️Prevents overfitting  
➡️Performs feature importance ranking
